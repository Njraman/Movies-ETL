# Movies-ETL

The purpose of this project is to enable Amazing prime video an online video streaming platform to determine which low budget movie would be popular, so that they could buy the streaming rights for the same.

Amazing Prime has to provide clean data to their team for analysis and for this purpose they need to source data from Wikipedia as well as movie ratings from a rating website. The data is extracted from these sources, transformed into a clean dataset and loaded into SQL tables.

As part of this process, we create a function that automates the process of taking in data from Wikipedia, Kaggle and MovieLens rating, transforming it and loading it into apporpriate tables.
